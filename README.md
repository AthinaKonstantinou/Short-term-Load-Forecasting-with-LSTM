# Short-term-Load-Forecasting-with-LSTM

Iso_NE.rar and Spain.rar contain the raw data and the format after the preprocessing. Spain_Data and Iso_NE_Data have the train, validation and test sets ready to be as input in the LSTM model. Spain_Models and Iso_NE_Models folders include the final models of the thesis which were tuned with hyperras library and we test them in Spain_Evaluation and Iso_NE_Evaluation Notebooks. Spain_dataset_preprocessing_1 and Spain_dataset_preprocessing_2 notebooks are the two steps of preprocessing. Spain_final_training_architecture_1 and Spain_final_training_architecture_2 are the two different architectures. Spain_Load_Decomposition_Clustering_DBI_Silhouette_CE_MAC_AppEntropy contains the decomposition of the time series, the k-means clustering method, and all the metrics we use in the thesis.
